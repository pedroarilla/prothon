# ABOUT

Prothon is a CLI project manager and time tracker written in Python by [Pedro Arilla](http://pedroarilla.com). Prothon helps you to record your project progress and stores the data in JSON files. Every project is divided into tasks. It is possible to create, update and archive projects. To track your tasks, Prothon offers a timer or manual records.

**Note:** Prothon is an evolution of Pomothon, my other CLI project manager and time tracker with Pomodoro timer and focused on recording session logs.

# HOW TO USE
